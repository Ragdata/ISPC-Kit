In this first iteration of the project, it will provision a single server running **Ubuntu 20.04** with the bare minimum required to make ISPConfig functional. THEN I'll think about making use of ISPConfig's horribly under-utilised Apps VHost to install and manage a suite of additional services ... I hope ...

## Installation
