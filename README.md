In this first iteration of the project, it will provision a single server running **Ubuntu 20.04** with the bare minimum required to make ISPConfig functional. THEN I'll think about making use of ISPConfig's horribly under-utilised Apps VHost to install and manage a suite of additional services ... I hope ...

## Requirements

For the moment, all you need is a freshly-installed VPS or bare metal server with a fresh copy of **Ubuntu 20.04**, and you're good to go.  Most previous versions of Ubuntu should work, as should most current Debian distributions - but for the moment, if you're NOT using **Ubuntu 20.04**, and you've run into problems using this script, for the moment at least, you're on your own.

## Installation

`ISPC-Kit` caters for a variety of different use cases, and requirs a little configuration before you execute the installation script.  See the [Project Docs](docs/README.md) (and particularly the [Installation Guide](docs/README.md#Installation-Guide)) for more information.
